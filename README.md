# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Industry

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue the service, enabling the company to take proactive steps to retain them.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer data to discover trends and patterns related to churn
- Build machine learning models to predict churn
- Identify key features contributing to customer attrition
- Provide actionable business insights to improve customer retention

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model building and evaluation
- **ELI5** – Model explainability and interpretation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Features**:
  - Customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen, dependents)
  - Account information (e.g., tenure, contract type, payment method)
  - Services subscribed (e.g., InternetService, OnlineSecurity, TechSupport)
  - Churn label (Yes/No)

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-analysis.git
   cd telecom-churn-analysis
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open and run the analysis notebook:

churn_analysis.ipynb

📊 Steps Performed
Data cleaning: Removed missing or invalid values

Data preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized churn patterns using plots

Feature selection: Identified important features influencing churn

Model training: Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers

Model evaluation: Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Model interpretation: Explained key features using ELI5

Insights & recommendations: Proposed strategies to reduce churn based on findings

✅ Key Results
Best performing model: Random Forest with ~80% accuracy

Top features affecting churn:

Tenure

MonthlyCharges

Contract type

TechSupport availability

Business insight: Customers on month-to-month contracts with no tech support and high monthly charges are more likely to churn
